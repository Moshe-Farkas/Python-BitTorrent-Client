Torrent is a data structure that hold decoded / parsed data read from the .torrent file.



after Torrent object is created peers should be handshaked.


peers:
    ip
    port
    state


when a client downloads a block from a peer it should yield control to the writing to disk coroutine
which yields back control when it finishes. the event loop should be filled with these downloading from peers
coroutines


step 1:
    send and receive handshake


piece.blocks should be an iterator generator. block_to_download = next(piece.blocks)


PIECE MANAGER:
    - is a async queue
    - acts like a conveyer belt
    - uses async file writing
    - needs to calculate the overall byte offset the blocks belongs to in the end file
